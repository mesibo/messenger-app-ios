### Generating OTP for the demo
The messenger App requires a valid phone number and OTP to login. Note that, we do not send OTP for App login. Instead, you can generate OTP for any number from the [mesibo console](https://mesibo.com/console)

Note that, all the users are private to your app/account. The demo app can not see or communicate with users from other apps. Also, the demo app uses contact synchronization to find other users of your app and hence ensure to use the correct phone number and other users are in your phone book. 

### Documentation
The documentation for the messenger is available here - [A fully featured WhatsApp clone using mesibo](https://mesibo.com/documentation/tutorials/open-source-whatsapp-clone/)

It describes 
- Compilation Instructions (Trivial though)
- Download [backend source code](https://github.com/mesibo/messenger-app-backend) and host it on your server (the default one is located on the mesibo server)
- Hosting entire real-time messaging and call server in your premise
- Other Customizations and Rebranding

## Downloading the Source Code

### Clone the Repository (Recommended)
If you have git installed, this is a recommended approach as you can quickly sync and stay up to date with the latest version. This is also a preferred way of downloading the code if you decide to contribute to the project. 

To download, open a terminal and issue following commands:

    $ mkdir Messenger
    $ cd Messenger
    $ git lfs install
    $ git clone https://github.com/mesibo/messenger-app-ios.git

### Download the code as a zip file
You can also download the complete iOS Messenger source code as a [zip file](https://github.com/mesibo/messenger-app-ios/archive/master.zip). Although simple, the downsize of this approach is that you will have to download the complete source code everytime it is updated on the repository. 

### Stay Up-to-date
Whatever approach you take to download the code, it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest changes, new features, fixes etc. Ensure to **Star(*)** the project on GitHub to get notified whenever the source code is updated.
